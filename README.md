# How to use Phonegen?
When you are in phonegen you can type help to see the commands.

-phonegen start is used to start generating phonenumbers. I have a default selection of countries to choose from, if the preferred country is not in this short list you can type y on the first popup. If you type n you have the short list. Than choose a country, output file name.(type .txt yourself!) or just press enter for output.txt. Than choose in mb the max size of the file. And then choose between verbose mode or normal(reccomended). In windows there is a glitch where it will print the first lines a lot. Than the outputfile is created.

-phonegen scan is used to scan a output file on mistakes. IMPORTANT! This is not optimised and still in development!

-convert is used to convert output files with .txt extention to other files. Json and csv are supported.

-clear clears the screen

-help shows you commands

-exit and quit let you quit phonegen

# IMPORTANT
This project and the features like gui.html and convert -gui ARE EXPERIMENTAL! It is recommened to use the cli version of this program

# What changed?
1. Added a fix to the phonegen scan, so it is less likely that it gives a false positive
2. Added a simple gui to convert. Use it with convert -gui, STILL A EXPERIMENT
3. Shhhhh I added a html file so you can send phonenumber files to a discord webhook, STILL A EXPERIMENT!
   version 1.4 OPEN with gui
